You have created a WPF Shader Effect Library project.  It currently has an effect called Effect1, and some utility functionality in it.  

To add a new ShaderEffect, choose Add New Item..., and then select WPF Shader Effect.  This will generate a .cs file and a .fx file.

Be sure that you set the BuildAction of the .fx file to "Effect" in the property grid, otherwise it won't be compiled or included.
